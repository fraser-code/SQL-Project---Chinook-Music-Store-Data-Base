# SQL-Project---Chinook-Music-Store-Data-Base

## Introduction
Welcome to my project! In this project, I have provided a comprehensive analysis of a music store's sales and operations through structured SQL queries and a relational database schema. The database comprises several tables including `Artist`, `Album`, `Track`, `Genre`, `MediaType`, `Playlist`, `Employee`, `Customer`, `Invoice`, and related linking tables, which together model the complex relationships within a typical music retail business.

## We will analyse our data to answer the following questions:
1) Who are the top 10 artists contributing the most to total revenue, and how much has each contributed?
2) Which albums hold the top 10 most sold songs?
3) Which are the top 10 genres sold (by quantity)?
4) Which artists have the highest number of albums?
5) Which are the top 3 selling artists of each genre?
