# SQL Project - Chinook Music Store Database

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL project on the Chinook Music Store Database. This project leverages structured SQL queries and a detailed relational database schema to provide a deep dive into the sales and operations of a typical music retail business. Covering key entities like `Artist`, `Album`, `Track`, and more, this analysis reveals intricate relationships and driving factors behind music sales and trends.

## Analysis Questions
We tackle the following key business questions to uncover insights into the store's operations:
1) **Top Revenue Contributing Artists**: Identify the top 10 artists contributing the most to total revenue and their respective contributions.
2) **Most Popular Albums**: Discover which albums contain the top 10 most-sold songs.
3) **Top Genres by Sales**: Analyze the top 10 genres sold by quantity.
4) **Artists with Extensive Catalogs**: Find out which artists have the highest number of albums.
5) **Leading Artists by Genre**: Determine the top 3 selling artists within each genre.
